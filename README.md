# Why
This is a stub for creating encrypted horizontally scalable Go gRPC services in Traefik. I was about to build something in Sandglass and thought that Traefik was more mature, so am going down this road. Thought this fully working boilerplate/example might be useful to others too to start their projects. It's a fully independent build of: https://docs.traefik.io/user-guide/grpc/

# Thoughts
Try combining this with an gRPC application round-robin balancer, and DNS Multivalue Answer Routing for a boss service.

# Instructions
Just build the project using build.sh and follow the instructions

# Thanks
Cheers to the engineers of gRPC, Traefik & protobuf to name a few.
